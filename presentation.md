# Lecture 04: Stacks

## Agenda
1. Introduction to Stacks
2. LIFO Principle
3. Stack Operations
4. Applications of Stacks
5. Implementation using Vectors

## Key Concepts
- Last In, First Out (LIFO)
- Stack operations: push, pop, top
- Underflow and overflow handling
- Time complexity: O(1)

## Code Examples
- Basic stack operations
- Using std::vector as underlying storage
- Exception handling for empty stack

## Applications
- Function call stacks
- Expression evaluation
- Undo mechanisms
- Browser back button

## Advantages
- Simple implementation
- Efficient operations
- Easy to understand
